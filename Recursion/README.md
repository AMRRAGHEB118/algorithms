## The factorial function is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is defined as the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

------------------------------------------------------

### Here's how the factorial function works:

* The function takes an integer argument num, which represents the number whose factorial is to be calculated.

* The function checks whether num is equal to 0 or 1 using the if statement. If num is 0 or 1, the function returns 1, since the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1 by definition.

* If num is greater than 1, the function calls itself with num-1 as the argument. This is the recursive step.

* The recursive call to factorial(num-1) calculates the factorial of num-1 by calling the factorial function again with num-2 as the argument. This process continues recursively until the base case is reached, when num becomes 0 or 1.

* Once the base case is reached, the recursive calls start returning and the function multiplies the result of the current call with num, which is the value that was passed in initially.

* The final result of the factorial function is the productof all the integers from 1 to num, which is computed by multiplying the result of the last recursive call with num.

------------------------------------------------------

For example, let's say we want to calculate the factorial of 5 using the factorial function. Here's how the function would work:

We call factorial(5).

* factorial(5) is not equal to 0 or 1, so it calls factorial(4).

* factorial(4) is not equal to 0 or 1, so it calls factorial(3).

* factorial(3) is not equal to 0 or 1, so it calls factorial(2).

* factorial(2) is not equal to 0 or 1, so it calls factorial(1).

* factorial(1) is equal to 1, so it returns 1.

* factorial(2) multiplies the result of factorial(1) (which is 1) with 2, and returns 2.

* factorial(3) multiplies the result of factorial(2) (which is 2) with 3, and returns 6.

* factorial(4) multiplies the result of factorial(3) (which is 6) with 4, and returns24.

* factorial(5) multiplies the result of factorial(4) (which is 24) with 5, and returns 120.

So, the final result of factorial(5) is 120, which is the factorial of 5.

Note that the recursive factorial function has a time complexity of O(n), since it has to make n function calls to calculate the factorial of n. This can be inefficient for large values of n, as it can lead to a large number of function calls and consume a lot of stack space. For very large values of n, an iterative approach may be more efficient.
